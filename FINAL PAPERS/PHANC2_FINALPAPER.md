## LightBulb: Overcoming Creative Blocks

## Introduction  
Creative professionals often face a persistent challenge in their work which hinders their productivity. This leads to delayed projects, mental fatigue, and struggling to find inspiration to draw from. It is a struggle that overlaps all of the creative fields out there, no matter what industry it is certain that every artist can relate to this experience. This problem is known as a ‘creative block’, the feeling of being unable to generate new organic ideas leading to dissatisfaction of the artists’ creative output. It is rooted in deeper issues within the creatives themselves, such as mental health. Creatives often have a sense of self doubt within themselves, due to their fear of failure as well as perfectionism. Especially in a profession where work is dependent on creative output, this period of stagnation causes creatives to feel vulnerable with the way they express themselves and their work, potentially leading to a negative self image and confidence. Therefore, an app that fosters a community where creative minds help each other come up with ideas through collaboration serves as an effective solution to overcome these creative blocks.

## Background
From my own personal experience, creative blocks occur when I struggle to come up with original ideas for the project I am working on. This happened very often especially when I was new to design and being creative, I would always feel like my work was dull and lacked originality. I always saw my work was always direct copies of inspiration I found, and it discouraged me to pursue design as a career, even if it was my passion. However, after gaining more experience, I realized that there were many other people who went through the exact same experiences I did. It was very insightful to learn how people have their own methods of overcoming this creative block. Therefore, I want to curate a platform that encourages people to work as a community to help each other spark inspiration and get over this mental block. Think Pinterest, but with more involvement and engagement within the community. This sense of encouragement is something that I wish I had back when I first started designing, and I believe that it has the potential to make a difference for creatives in all stages of their work.

## Project Purpose & Vision
The LightBulb app is to be more than just a tool for productivity. The purpose of the app is to help creatives overcome their creative blocks and rediscover motivation and inspiration for their work. The aim is for creatives to reconnect with their creative process, improving the quality of their work which is something that is constantly affected by creative blocks. The target audience for this platform is geared towards creative professionals such as artists, designers, or creative writers, but is also inclusive towards everybody at different levels of experience who needs help getting their creative work started. Lightbulb offers a space for collaborative idea sharing and finding inspiration through interactive features and fostering a supportive, creative community. The core features of the app will be divided into two key elements: informational content that educates users on the history of different creative fields to draw inspiration from, and a collaborative community space for users to share ideas, provide feedback, and inspire one another. I envision the app to be shaped by the community it fosters, adapting to the increasing creative fields or trends that are emerging in real time. This community-driven element will contribute to the core value of the app, which is to mitigate the pressure of perfection creatives put on themselves, and instead create a space for experimentation and growth in their creative work. 

## Development Timeline and Phases
The development of LightBulb is planned to follow a phased approach over the course of approximately 24 weeks. The development process will be broken down into five key stages. This includes planning and research, initial design and prototyping, backend development and integration, testing and feedback, and public launch. Each phase gradually builds the foundation of the platform to be functional and testable throughout all stages of development. The approach is agile and has a community centered workflow where features can be adjusted based on user feedback, as the methods that each creative has to overcome creative blocks varies from person to person. This ensures that LightBulb aligns with the needs of the community it fosters and is accessible to contributors at every level.

## Phase 1: Planning and Research (Weeks 1-4)
The first phase aims to outline the scope of the project and understand the diverse needs of the community, which in this case are creatives. During this phase, interviews and surveys are conducted with artists, designers, or those with a creative profession to gather insight on the common causes of creative blocks and identify what features would provide the most value to these pain points. We will also gather insight on their preferred methods of finding inspiration, and conduct competitive analysis of similar platforms such as Pinterest or Behance to identify core features and opportunities for differentiation. The goal is to define the minimum viable product (MVP) that includes collaborative features for the community to engage with each other. The GitHub repository will be initialized with a clear folder structure and documentation. This documentation includes README.md files, contribution guidelines and a roadmap to establish the structure for open collaboration. Communication channels and collaborative platforms will be set up to streamline the process of working across teams and coordination when building the platform.

## Phase 2: Initial Design and Prototyping (Weeks 5-8)
In this phase, wireframes of the user interface will be produced to create low fidelity prototypes that will visualize how users will interact with LightBulb. Emphasis will be placed on designing intuitive user flows for browsing content, engaging in discussions and uploading work into the community space. These prototypes will be tested for usability and adjusted based on early feedback. Once the skeletal structure of the UI has been established, frontend development will begin building static versions of the interface using modern frameworks such as React that supports modular design. The purpose of this phase is to ensure that the platform follows an intuitive flow that makes sense in a creatives’ workflow. 

## Phase 3: Phase 3: Backend Development and Integration (Weeks 9-14)
This phase consists of introducing the technical infrastructure required to bring the features in LightBulb to life. The development of backend systems will support core functionalities such as content storage and management, interactive brainstorming threads, and user uploads to a community feed. The frontend will be integrated with backend services to enable dynamic content display and user input. Flexibility in the database schema is important to accommodate for a variety of content, since creative fields are subjective and vary into a lot of categories. Technical workflows include setting up issue tracking, branching conventions, and testing automation to support scalable development. Contributors will be invited to begin working on open issues, with issues being labeled by difficulty and priority.

To add on, this stage also introduces the development of the informational content engine LightBulb is going to be using to educate and inspire users by drawing from a curated pool of creative establishments. This means that the app will integrate publicly accessible digital archives, exhibits, and collections from museums and education institutions through open APIs or embedded as curated features. It allows for users to explore inspiration through the history of their creative fields such as design movements, by viewing featured works and brief descriptions of each artist and their artwork. These sources will be credited and metadata in each art piece such as date of origin, medium etc. will be used to categorize the content. This ensures that users will have access to high-quality inspirational content that promotes learning about the cultural context of their creative field.

## Phase 4: Testing and Feedback (Weeks 15-18)
This phase is to conduct testing of LightBulb and evaluate the functionality and usability of the platform. This is done through internal testing and community engagement, where early users and contributors will test an early working version of the app in a closed beta. Having a small community of users to test will generate content that can help identify bugs and gather feedback on key features. Discussion threads will be used for users to voice their evaluation, where GitHub issues will be created from these user suggestions. Key improvements to be made will be prioritized in the Kanban board. This iterative cycle of feedback and improvement supports an agile methodology and also creates a sense of trust to the users due to the continuous responsiveness and improvements of the app.

## Phase 5: Public Launch (Weeks 19-24)
This final stage of the development process is focused on refining the platform’s performance and functionality. There will also be preparation for long-term growth, such as setting up modular infrastructure for scaling and expanding the core team that maintains the app. Towards the end of the phase is where LightBulb will be launched publicly, and the platform will be promoted through creative communities and university networks to grow the user base. A public roadmap will be established that will outline future changes driven by the continuous feedback from the community. The platform’s open-source structure enables for iterative development that is flexible to the needs of what users will want in the app.

## Technology Stack
The technology stack for LightBulb will support a community-driven platform that is scalable and modular that can accommodate the dual focus on both community engagement and curated informational content. The frontend of the platform will be built using React, which enables flexibility in building interactive user interfaces due to its component-based architecture. This structure is especially useful for organizing key features such as community feeds, discussion threads, and interactive content displays. Tailwind CSS will also be used to streamline styling of the app and maintain visual consistency. As for the backend, Node.js and Express enable real-time interactions like collaborative feedback threads as it is capable of handling user input in real-time. A NoSQL database such as MongoDB will be used to store dynamic types of content given the variety of creative content that users may upload or engage with. This will also be used to handle and store historical archive content sourced from open-access APIs that is integrated from museums and educational institutions. The backend will also power the informational content engine, integrating public datasets from museums or academic institutions and structuring them using customizable schemas. GitHub will be used to support open-source collaboration and is responsible for version control and tracking issues. Contributors to the project will follow clear guidelines that are established in the early phases of development and are managed via GitHub Issues and Pull Requests, and technical workflows will include automated tools to maintain consistency across contributions. To reduce onboarding friction for contributors, the development environment will be deployed locally through Docker to provide a secure environment for development. Community design assets will be worked on collaboratively using Figma, a platform to design wireframes and mockups of LightBulb. 

## Technical debt
Technical debt is expected as LightBulb evolves into a fully functioning platform. This may be due to it being an open source project, which could lead to trade-offs in code efficiency, the clarity of documentation, or how cohesive the system of the app is as a whole. To address these problems, there will be a structured approach that includes tagging and tracking technical debt directly within GitHub Issues, allowing contributors to flag any unstable code they come across or missing documentation. Review cycles over a certain period of time will help create a routine of looking over and addressing these issues, and implementing sprint sessions to dedicate time to clean up and optimize code will help mitigate the debt accrued over time. To add on, automated tools will be used in the development pipeline to enforce consistency and detect potential bugs. The main goal is to make sure that the technical debt is visible and this approach ensures that the platform’s long-term maintenance and scalability is not compromised by these issues.

## Community Governance
The structure behind LightBulb’s structure will be designed for transparency and long-term sustainability as an open-source platform. The project will adopt a distributed approach where major responsibilities are gradually shared with experienced contributors rather than a centralized control structure. At the earlier stages of development, a group of core maintainers will be involved in the decision-making, project planning, and quality assurance aspects of the platform. As the community expands, a tier system will be introduced where responsibilities will be delegated according to which tier each contributor is in. For example, contributors, reviewers, and maintainers. This ensures that contributors that are more active in the project can take on more responsibility and leadership. A clearly documented governance model will be maintained in the repository, including contribution guidelines and responsibilities associated with each role in the community. Open discussions on major decisions and topics such as feature proposals will be held through GitHub Discussions or community threads. This way contributors can have a voice and vote or comment on changes in the platform. Over time, the goal is to form different working groups around the core areas of the platform. This includes areas such as UI/UX design, backend development, and community programming, which would enable contributors to take initiatives to shape the evolution of the platform in the long term. 

## Scalability
Scalability is a key technical and organizational challenge that must not be overlooked. As LightBulb continues to grow over time, scalability will be a concern for maintaining usability. The platform will need to support increasing traffic, more diverse types of content etc. which means designing the backend using modular architecture to handle flexible data structures and scale independently without disrupting the overall functionality. The use of a flexible NoSQL database will enable the backend to support asynchronous operations and allows for quicker retrieval of content. Strategies such as database indexing will be implemented to ensure the capability of long-term increases in user uploads. And to maintain environmental consistency for platform development, using Docker will enable smoother scaling of services as contributor teams and infrastructure increases. It is important to address scalability issues as it has a direct impact on the platform’s ability to maintain performance. 

## Conclusion
LightBulb represents more than just an art inspiration app, it is a platform that fosters a community that helps build ideas off each other to overcome their creative stagnation. By offering a space where creatives can share, explore and learn from each other, it encourages experimentation that helps creatives learn more about themselves. Through the integration of open-source principles such as community governance and modular design, it allows for the platform to be shaped into whatever the community needs it to be. LightBulb is intended to be seamlessly integrated into a creatives’ workflow, and serves as an environment for support and growth through collaboration.
